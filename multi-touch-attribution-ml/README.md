# Attribution Modeling and Budget Optimization

## Overview

This project focuses on evaluating and optimizing marketing attribution models to improve budget allocation strategies. The aim is to identify the most effective marketing channels and touchpoints that contribute to customer conversions, ensuring efficient use of resources and maximizing return on investment (ROI).

## Project Objectives

- Analyze different attribution models to understand their impact on marketing strategies.
- Implement and compare single-touch and multi-touch attribution approaches.
- Optimize budget allocation using data-driven insights.
- Explore trends in user interactions and channel performance.

## Attribution Models Explored

### Single-Touch Attribution Models
1. **Last-Touch Attribution**
   - Assigns 100% of the conversion credit to the last marketing channel.
   - Useful for campaigns with fewer than five channels.
   - **Limitations**: Ignores earlier touchpoints that may have influenced the conversion.

2. **First-Touch Attribution**
   - Assigns all credit to the first interaction point with the customer.
   - Useful for understanding which channels attract initial interest.
   - **Limitations**: Overlooks subsequent interactions that contribute to the final conversion.

### Multi-Touch Attribution Models
- Explores models that distribute credit across multiple touchpoints:
  - **Linear Attribution**
  - **Time Decay Attribution**
  - **Position-Based Attribution**

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains information on user interactions across various marketing channels and conversion events. Key fields include:

- **User Interaction Data**:
  - Channel names
  - Interaction timestamps
- **Conversion Details**:
  - Conversion status
  - Value associated with the conversion

## Approach

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understand the distribution of interactions and conversions.
- Identify patterns in user behavior across channels.
- Detect outliers, missing values, and inconsistencies.

### 2. Attribution Modeling
- Implement and evaluate different attribution models.
- Compare performance and insights offered by each model.
- Visualize the impact of marketing channels on conversion outcomes.

### 3. Budget Optimization
- Use data insights to allocate budgets effectively.
- Simulate scenarios to test the impact of different allocation strategies.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Measure the performance of attribution models using metrics like conversion accuracy and ROI.
- Validate insights with historical data.

## Key Insights

1. **Channel Performance**:
   - Certain channels (e.g., paid ads or email campaigns) contribute more consistently to conversions.
   - Some touchpoints act as supporting channels rather than primary drivers.

2. **Optimization Opportunities**:
   - Budget reallocation towards high-performing channels can significantly boost conversions.
   - Reducing investments in underperforming channels improves overall efficiency.

3. **Customer Journey Complexity**:
   - Multi-touch models reveal the interplay between channels and the importance of supporting touchpoints.
   - Single-touch models oversimplify user behavior and may lead to suboptimal decisions.
