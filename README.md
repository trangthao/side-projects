## **Projects by Industry**

### **1. Travel and Hospitality**
- **Expedia Hotel Recommendation System**  
  - **Description:** Developed a machine learning model to predict a user's likelihood of booking one of 100 hotel clusters based on Expedia's customer interaction data. The system enhances personalized hotel recommendations, improving user satisfaction and platform engagement.  
  - **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost.  
  - **Key Highlights:** Predicted hotel clusters using classification models to recommend contextually relevant hotels. Employed clustering to group similar hotels and handle sparse data for newly listed hotels.

### **2. Banking**
- **Attention-based NLP Classification**  
  - **Description:** Developed a text classification model leveraging attention mechanisms to classify consumer complaints into financial product categories.  
  - **Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch, GloVe, NLTK, Scikit-learn.  
  - **Key Highlights:** Preprocessed complaint narratives, used pre-trained GloVe embeddings for text encoding, implemented a bidirectional LSTM with an attention mechanism, and achieved high classification accuracy with interpretable attention weights.

- **Customer Churn Prediction Analysis**  
  - **Description:** Developed an ensemble-based machine learning model to predict customer churn for a bank, enabling proactive retention strategies to reduce revenue loss.
  - **Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random Forest, Matplotlib, Seaborn.  
  - **Key Highlights:** EDA to uncover churn drivers, feature engineering for customer behavior insights, high recall and precision for identifying at-risk customers, and actionable retention strategies to reduce churn rate.
 
### **3. Advertising**
- **Criteo Advertising CATE Estimation**  
  - **Description:** Implemented Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) estimation using the Criteo Uplift Modeling Dataset to predict and optimize user responsiveness to advertising campaigns.  
  - **Tech Stack:** Python, EconML, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
  - **Key Highlights:** Used causal inference techniques like Double Machine Learning and meta-learners, generated Qini and uplift curves for evaluation, and provided actionable insights for ad campaign targeting and budget optimization.
