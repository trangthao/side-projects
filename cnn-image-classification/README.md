# CNN Image Classification

## Business Context
The goal of this project is to classify images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Image classification has various applications, including object recognition, medical imaging, and autonomous systems. In this project, we aim to train a CNN model to classify images into predefined categories, enabling automated image tagging, sorting, and identification tasks.

By accurately classifying images, the model can be integrated into systems to automate processes such as categorizing products, detecting diseases, or recognizing objects in real-time environments.

## Key Terms
- **Image Classification**: The task of assigning a label to an image based on its content.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: A type of deep neural network designed to process and classify images.
- **Training Data**: The set of labeled images used to train the model.
- **Model Evaluation**: The process of testing the model's performance on unseen data.

## Data Overview
This project uses a dataset of images that are categorized into various classes. The dataset includes:

- **Image Files**: Each image is associated with a label indicating its category.
- **Labels**: The categories to which the images belong.

The dataset includes the following key components:
- **Images**: Visual data in the form of images for classification.
- **Labels**: Each image is labeled with a specific category, e.g., 'cat', 'dog', etc.

## Objective
The objective of this notebook is to build and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can classify images into multiple categories. The goal is to achieve high classification accuracy, which will enable the model to be used in real-world applications for automated image tagging, sorting, and recognition.

## Notebook Overview

- **Business Context**: The notebook begins by providing context for the business problem and explaining how image classification can be leveraged to automate processes and improve efficiency.
- **Data Preparation**: The data is preprocessed, including image resizing, normalization, and splitting into training and test sets.
- **Modeling**: A CNN model is built using Keras and TensorFlow. The model architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by dense layers for classification.
- **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Metrics are plotted, and performance is assessed to determine the best model.
- **Fine-tuning**: Hyperparameter tuning is done to optimize the model's performance.

The notebook concludes with a final model ready for deployment in real-world image classification tasks.
