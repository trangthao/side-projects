# Text Classification with LSTM

## Business Context
The goal of this project is to classify text data using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is particularly well-suited for sequential data such as text. Text classification has various applications, including sentiment analysis, spam detection, and content categorization. In this project, the LSTM model is trained to classify text into predefined categories, enabling automated tagging, sorting, and content understanding.

By accurately classifying text, the model can be integrated into systems to automate content moderation, filter spam, or categorize customer feedback for further analysis.

## Key Terms
- **Text Classification**: The task of assigning a label or category to a given piece of text.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: A type of RNN used for sequential data analysis, particularly useful for text and time-series data.
- **Training Data**: The dataset consisting of labeled text examples used to train the model.
- **Model Evaluation**: The process of testing the model's performance on unseen data using metrics such as accuracy and F1 score.

## Data Overview
This project uses a dataset of text examples that are categorized into various labels. The dataset includes:

- **Text Data**: Raw text that needs to be classified into predefined categories.
- **Labels**: Categories or tags assigned to each text example.

The dataset includes the following key components:
- **Text**: The text data that needs to be classified (e.g., reviews, messages, etc.).
- **Labels**: The predefined categories for each piece of text (e.g., "positive", "negative", etc.).

## Objective
The objective of this notebook is to build and evaluate an LSTM-based model that can classify text data into multiple categories. The goal is to achieve high classification accuracy, which will enable the model to automate the classification of text data for various applications, such as sentiment analysis or topic categorization.

## Notebook Overview

- **Business Context**: The notebook begins by explaining the real-world applications of text classification and how LSTM networks can be used to automatically classify text into predefined categories.
- **Data Preparation**: The text data is preprocessed, including tokenization, padding, and splitting into training and test sets.
- **Modeling**: A LSTM model is built using Keras and TensorFlow. The model consists of an embedding layer, LSTM layers, and a dense output layer for classification.
- **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Visualization techniques such as loss and accuracy curves are used to analyze performance.
- **Fine-tuning**: Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the model's performance, including adjustments to the LSTM layers and learning rate.

The notebook concludes with a trained LSTM model ready for deployment in real-world text classification tasks.
