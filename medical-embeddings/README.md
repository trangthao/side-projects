# Medical Embeddings for Clinical Trial Data

## Business Context
This project focuses on building custom word embeddings for clinical trial data to enhance information retrieval and support decision-making in the medical field. The goal is to train word embeddings specifically for medical terms and clinical trial information related to diseases, treatments, and outcomes. By creating specialized embeddings, we aim to improve the accuracy of text-based search engines and assist researchers in efficiently finding relevant clinical trial data.

This project can help streamline the search for clinical trials related to specific conditions or treatments, enabling faster access to relevant research and improving decision-making for healthcare professionals.

## Key Terms
- **Word Embeddings**: A method of representing words in a vector space, where semantically similar words are closer together.
- **Clinical Trial Data**: Information from clinical trials, including trial IDs, descriptions, diseases, and treatments.
- **Text-based Search Engine**: A tool that allows users to search for relevant documents (e.g., clinical trials) based on textual queries.
- **Cosine Similarity**: A metric used to measure how similar two documents or word vectors are in terms of their direction in the vector space.

## Data Overview
This project uses a dataset containing clinical trial descriptions, specifically focusing on clinical trials related to COVID-19. The dataset includes:

- **Clinical Trial Information**: Abstracts and titles of clinical trials, which describe the study's focus, methods, and outcomes.
- **Medical Terms**: Medical terminology related to diseases, symptoms, treatments, and outcomes.

The dataset includes the following key components:
- **Clinical Trial ID**: A unique identifier for each clinical trial.
- **Abstract**: A summary of the clinical trial’s aims, methods, and results.
- **Title**: The title of the clinical trial.
- **Keywords**: Terms related to the clinical trial, including disease names, treatments, and outcomes.

## Objective
The objective of this notebook is to build custom word embeddings for clinical trial data, using models like Word2Vec and FastText to capture semantic relationships between medical terms. These embeddings are then used to create a search engine that can retrieve relevant clinical trials based on user queries, leveraging cosine similarity for ranking results.

## Libraries
The following libraries are required to run the notebook for Python 3.10.12:

- `gensim==4.2.0`
- `tensorflow==2.11.0`
- `keras==2.11.0`
- `numpy==1.24.4`
- `pandas==1.5.3`
- `matplotlib==3.7.3`
- `seaborn==0.12.2`
- `nltk==3.7`

## Notebook Overview

- **Business Context**: The notebook starts by discussing the importance of text-based search and how word embeddings can be used to improve information retrieval in clinical trial datasets.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The text data is cleaned and preprocessed, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization to prepare the text for embedding training.
- **Embedding Models**: Word2Vec and FastText models are trained on the clinical trial dataset to create embeddings for medical terms. These models are compared based on their performance in capturing semantic relationships between terms.
- **Search Engine Creation**: Using the trained embeddings, a search engine is built that allows users to search for clinical trials based on similarity to a query. The system uses cosine similarity to rank and retrieve the most relevant trials.
- **Evaluation**: The quality of the embeddings and the search engine’s effectiveness are evaluated based on the relevance of retrieved trials, using query examples and comparing the results from the two embedding models.

The notebook concludes with a working search engine for clinical trial data that can be further fine-tuned or deployed for use in real-world applications.
