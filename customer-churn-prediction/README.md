# **Customer Churn Prediction Analysis**

This project involves building a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn from a bank. By predicting churn with high accuracy, the bank can implement proactive measures such as customer engagement campaigns, personalized offers, and grievance redressal to retain valuable customers and arrest revenue decline.

## **Problem Statement**

Bank XYZ has been losing customers to competitors, leading to a significant decline in quarterly revenues. The bank needs a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn so that appropriate interventions can be made to prevent churn and improve retention rates.

---

## **Objectives**

1. Build a machine learning model to predict customers likely to churn.
2. Analyze customer behavior and segments to understand churn drivers.
3. Provide actionable insights to the business team for retention strategies.

## **Approach**

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**  
   - Gather customer transaction data, account activity, and demographic details.
   - Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Analyze customer demographics, account activity trends, and other behavioral attributes.
   - Identify key factors contributing to customer churn.

3. **Model Development:**  
   - Train ensemble machine learning models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost for churn prediction.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Insights and Recommendations:**  
   - Segment customers based on churn propensity.
   - Propose retention strategies such as personalized offers and customer outreach.
