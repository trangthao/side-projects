The efficient movement of goods is necessary to ensure that businesses can operate effectively and customers can receive their products on time. However, determining the appropriate mode of transport for each shipment can be challenging. It requires considering various factors such as the type of product being transported, the distance, and the destination.\n","Choosing the appropriate mode of transport for each shipment can significantly affect the delivery time, cost, and safety of the goods being transported.\n","\n","For example, air transport is generally faster but more expensive than other modes, while sea transport is slower but more cost-effective for large shipments. The wrong choice of transport mode can result in delays, damage to the goods, or increased costs for the business. By accurately predicting the appropriate mode of transport for each shipment, businesses can optimize their logistics operations, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tQodg9CYA-q9"},"source":["![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1578575437130-527eed3abbec?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1170&q=80)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IgnQa4r_BhEq"},"source":["To build the machine learning model, we first explore the dataset using BigQuery.

The query is selecting certain numerical features, such as weight and value, as well as some categorical feature Size.\n","\n","In addition to extracting the original Size feature, this query is also performing one-hot encoding on the Size feature, which is essentially converting the categorical variable into a binary vector. For instance, Size_A column will have a value of 1 if the original Size value was A, and 0 otherwise. Similarly, other columns Size_B, Size_C and Size_D will have values of 1 if the original Size value was B, C or D, respectively.\n","\n","\n","### **One Hot Encoding**\n","\n","One-hot encoding is a process of representing categorical data in a numerical format that machine learning models can understand. In machine learning, it's common to have categorical data, such as gender, color, or size, that cannot be directly processed by algorithms. One-hot encoding solves this problem by converting categorical data into numerical data, which algorithms can process.\n","\n","One-hot encoding is achieved by creating a binary column for each possible category in a categorical variable. Each binary column represents a category and is set to 1 if the observation belongs to that category or 0 otherwise. For example, in the given code, the Size categorical variable is one-hot encoded by creating four binary columns (Size_A, Size_B, Size_C, and Size_D) that represent the four possible categories in the Size variable. If an observation belongs to a particular category, the binary column representing that category is set to 1, and all other columns are set to 0.\n","\n","One-hot encoding is an essential preprocessing step in many machine learning projects, as it allows categorical data to be used as input to machine learning algorithms, which typically expect numerical inputs."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":66,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":235},"id":"dqy9FgE1GfrA","outputId":"19c367ab-02dd-40ae-9dae-74b87cae8107","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736712720936,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":5069,"user":{"displayName":"Trang Thao","userId":"09726438036581574948"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>"],"application/javascript":["\n","        window.kuchbhi=new Promise(resolve => {\n","            \n","\n","        function reqListener () {\n","\n","        var ipResponse = this.responseText\n","        console.log(ipResponse);\n","        //return ipResponse\n","\n","        const req2 = new XMLHttpRequest();\n","        req2.addEventListener(\"load\",function(){\n","\n","            //  this blocks runs after req2 and prints whole data    \n","        console.log(this.responseText)\n","        //IPython.notebook.kernel.execute(\n","            //     \"json_obj = \" + JSON.stringify(this.responseText, null, 4)\n","            // );\n","        //document.querySelector(\"#output-area\").appendChild(document.createTextNode(JSON.stringify(this.responseText)));\n","        //var command= \"json_obj = \" + JSON.stringify(this.responseText)\n","        //var kernel = IPython.notebook.kernel;\n","        //kernel.execute(command);\n","        resolve(JSON.parse(this.responseText))\n","\n","\n","        });\n","        req2.open(\"GET\", \"https://ipapi.co/\"+JSON.parse(ipResponse).ip+\"/json/\");\n","        req2.send();\n","\n","\n","        }\n","\n","        const req = new XMLHttpRequest();\n","        req.addEventListener(\"load\", reqListener);\n","        req.open(\"GET\", \"https://api64.ipify.org?format=json\");\n","        req.send();\n","\n","\n","\n","        }\n","        );\n","        //kuchbhi()\n","        "]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   Net Weight     Value  Packaging Cost  Expiry Period    Length    Height  \\\n","0    0.231087 -0.489163        0.019398       0.749709 -0.444208  0.634931   \n","1    0.221333 -0.451410        0.188049       0.516770 -0.477535  0.502226   \n","2    0.142139 -0.795507        0.035681       0.429083 -0.425405  0.422865   \n","3    0.080169 -0.743728        0.043605       0.634501 -0.654449  0.382735   \n","4    0.046239 -0.409716       -0.038602       0.682835 -0.341292  0.512774   \n","\n","      Width    Volume  Perishable Index  Flammability Index  ...

In other words, the data used to train the algorithm includes input variables and corresponding output variables. The algorithm learns to predict the output variable based on the input variables. Supervised learning can be further divided into two categories: regression and classification.\n","\n","* **Regression** is a type of supervised learning where the algorithm learns to predict a continuous output variable. In other words, the output variable is a numerical value. Examples of regression problems include predicting housing prices, stock prices, or the amount of rainfall in a particular area.\n","\n","* **Classification**, on the other hand, is a type of supervised learning where the algorithm learns to predict a discrete output variable. In other words, the output variable is a category or label. Examples of classification problems include predicting whether an email is spam or not, whether a tumor is malignant or benign, or whether a customer is likely to churn or not.\n","\n","## **Decision Trees**\n","\n","**Decision Trees in Classification**\n","\n","Decision trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification as well as regression problems. They are widely used in machine learning because they are easy to understand and interpret, and can handle both categorical and numerical data. The idea behind decision trees is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.\n","\n","The decision tree starts with a single node, called the root node, which represents the entire dataset. The root node is then split into several child nodes based on the value of a chosen feature. The process of selecting the best feature and splitting the nodes is repeated recursively for each child node until a stopping criterion is reached. This results in a tree-like structure that represents the decision rules learned from the data.\n","\n","Each node in the decision tree represents a decision or a test of a feature value, and each branch represents the possible outcomes of that decision. The leaves of the tree represent the final decision or the class label assigned to the input data.\n","\n","**Splitting Criteria**\n","\n","To build a decision tree, we need a measure that determines how to split the data at each node. The splitting criterion is chosen based on the type of data and the nature of the problem. The most common splitting criteria are:\n","\n","* Gini index: measures the impurity of a set of labels. It calculates the probability of misclassifying a randomly chosen element from the set, and is used to minimize misclassification errors.\n","* Information gain: measures the reduction in entropy (uncertainty) after a split. It is used to maximize the information gain in each split.\n","* Chi-square: measures the difference between observed and expected frequencies of the classes. It is used to minimize the deviation between the observed and expected class distribution.\n","\n","**Overfitting in Decision Trees**\n","\n","One of the main challenges in building decision trees is overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the tree is too complex and fits the training data too well, resulting in poor performance on new and unseen data. This can be addressed by pruning the tree or limiting its depth, or by using ensemble methods such as bagging and boosting.\n","\n","**Ensemble Methods**\n","\n","Ensemble methods are techniques that combine multiple models to improve performance and reduce overfitting. The two most common ensemble methods used with decision trees are:\n","\n","* Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): involves training multiple decision trees on different subsets of the training data and then combining their predictions by averaging or voting. This reduces the variance and improves the stability of the model.\n","* Boosting: involves training multiple decision trees sequentially, where each subsequent tree focuses on the misclassified examples of the previous tree. This reduces the bias and improves the accuracy of the model.\n","\n","Deecision trees are powerful tools for classification problems that provide a clear and interpretable representation of the decision rules learned from the data. The choice of splitting criterion, stopping criterion, and ensemble method can have a significant impact on the performance and generalization of the model.\n","\n","### **Bagging**\n","\n","\n","\n","Bagging is an ensemble learning technique that aims to decrease the variance of a single estimator by combining the predictions from multiple learners. The basic idea behind bagging is to generate multiple versions of the training dataset through random sampling with replacement, and then train a separate classifier for each sampled dataset. The predictions from these individual classifiers are then combined using averaging or voting to obtain a final prediction.\n","\n","**Algorithm:**\n","\n","Suppose we have a training set D of size n, and we want to train a classifier using bagging. Here are the steps involved:\n","\n","* Create k different bootstrap samples from D, each of size n.\n","* Train a classifier on each bootstrap sample.\n","* When making predictions on a new data point, take the average or majority vote of the predictions from each of the k classifiers.\n","\n","\n","**Mathematical Explanation:**\n","\n","Suppose we have a binary classification problem with classes -1 and 1. Let's also assume that we have a training set D of size n, and we want to train a decision tree classifier using bagging.\n","\n","**Bootstrap Sample**: For each of the k classifiers, we create a bootstrap sample of size n by sampling with replacement from D. This means that each bootstrap sample may contain duplicates of some instances and may also miss some instances from the original dataset. Let's denote the i-th bootstrap sample as D_i.\n","\n","**Train a Classifier**: We train a decision tree classifier T_i on each bootstrap sample D_i. This gives us k classifiers T_1, T_2, ..., T_k.\n","\n","**Combine Predictions**: To make a prediction on a new data point x, we take the majority vote of the predictions from each of the k classifiers.\n","\n","The idea behind bagging is that the variance of the prediction error decreases as k increases. This is because each classifier has a chance to explore a different part of the feature space due to the random sampling with replacement, and the final prediction is a combination of these diverse classifiers.\n","\n","### **Random Forest**\n","\n","\n","\n","Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that builds a large number of decision trees and combines them to make a final prediction. It is a type of bagging method, where multiple decision trees are trained on random subsets of the training data and features. The algorithm then averages the predictions of these individual trees to produce a final prediction. Random Forest is particularly useful for handling high-dimensional data and for avoiding overfitting.\n","\n","**Algorithm of Random Forest**\n","\n","The algorithm of Random Forest can be summarized in the following steps:\n","\n","* Start by randomly selecting a subset of the training data, with replacement. This subset is called the bootstrap sample.\n","\n","* Next, randomly select a subset of features from the full feature set.\n","\n","* Build a decision tree using the bootstrap sample and the selected subset of features. At each node of the tree, select the best feature and split the data based on the selected feature.\n","\n","* Repeat steps 1-3 to build multiple trees.\n","\n","* Finally, combine the predictions of all trees to make a final prediction. For classification, this is usually done by taking a majority vote of the predicted classes. For regression, this is usually done by taking the average of the predicted values.\n","\n","\n","**Mathematics Behind Random Forest**\n","\n","The mathematics behind Random Forest involves the use of decision trees and the bootstrap sampling technique. Decision trees are constructed using a recursive binary partitioning algorithm that splits the data based on the values of the selected features. At each node, the algorithm chooses the feature and the split point that maximizes the information gain. Information gain measures the reduction in entropy or impurity of the target variable after the split. The goal is to minimize the impurity of the subsets after each split.\n","\n","Bootstrap sampling is a statistical technique that involves randomly sampling the data with replacement to create multiple subsets. These subsets are used to train individual decision trees. By using bootstrap samples, the algorithm can generate multiple versions of the same dataset with slightly different distributions. This introduces randomness into the training process, which helps to reduce overfitting.\n","\n","\n","\n","**Difference between Bagging and Random Forest**\n","\n","Bagging and Random Forest are both ensemble learning algorithms that involve training multiple models on random subsets of the data. The main difference between the two is the way the individual models are trained.\n","\n","Bagging involves training multiple models using the bootstrap sampling technique, but each model uses the same set of features. This can lead to correlated predictions, which reduces the variance but not necessarily the bias of the model.\n","\n","Random Forest, on the other hand, involves training multiple models using the bootstrap sampling technique, but each model uses a randomly selected subset of features. This introduces additional randomness into the model and helps to reduce the correlation between individual predictions. Random Forest can achieve better performance than Bagging, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data or noisy features. In simpler terms it uses subsets of observations as well as features.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","### **Boosting**\n","\n","Boosting is a machine learning algorithm that works by combining several weak models (also known as base learners) into a strong model. The goal of boosting is to reduce the bias and variance of the base learners by iteratively adding new models to the ensemble that focus on correcting the errors made by the previous models. In other words, the boosting algorithm tries to learn from the mistakes of the previous models and improve the overall accuracy of the ensemble.\n","\n","Boosting works by assigning higher weights to the data points that the previous models misclassified, and lower weights to the ones that were classified correctly. This ensures that the new model focuses more on the difficult data points that the previous models struggled with, and less on the ones that were already well-classified. As a result, the new model is more specialized and can improve the accuracy of the ensemble.\n","\n","There are several types of boosting algorithms, including AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting), Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting). Each of these algorithms has its own approach to assigning weights to the data points and building the new models, but they all share the fundamental idea of iteratively improving the accuracy of the ensemble by combining weak models into a strong one. Boosting is a powerful algorithm that has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in many machine learning tasks, such as image classification, natural language processing, and recommender systems.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","**Difference between Bagging and Boosting**\n","\n","\n","It's important to remember that boosting is a generic method, not a specific model, in order to comprehend it. Boosting involves specifying a weak model, such as regression or decision trees, and then improving it. In Ensemble Learning, the primary difference between Bagging and Boosting is that in bagging, weak learners are trained in simultaneously, but in boosting, they are trained sequentially. This means that each new model iteration increases the weights of the prior model's misclassified data. This redistribution of weights aids the algorithm in determining which parameters it should focus on in order to increase its performance.\n","\n","Both the Ensemble techniques are used in a different way as well.  Bagging methods, for example, are often used on poor learners who have large variance and low bias such as decision trees because they tend to overfit, whereas boosting methods are employed when there is low variance and high bias. While bagging can help prevent overfitting, boosting methods are more vulnerable to it because of a simple fact they continue to build on weak learners and continue to minimise error. This can lead to overfitting on the training data but specifying a decent number of models to be generated or hyperparameter tuning,  regularization can help in this case, if overfitting encountered.\n","\n","\n","### **Gradient Boosting**\n","\n","The primary idea behind this technique is to develop models in a sequential manner, with each model attempting to reduce the mistakes of the previous model.The additive model, loss function, and a weak learner are the three fundamental components of Gradient Boosting.\n","\n","The method provides a direct interpretation of boosting in terms of numerical optimization of the loss function using Gradient Descent. We employ Gradient Boosting Regressor when the target column is continuous, and Gradient Boosting Classifier when the task is a classification problem. The \"Loss function\" is the only difference between the two. The goal is to use gradient descent to reduce this loss function by adding weak learners. Because it is based on loss functions, for regression problems, Mean squared error (MSE) will be used, and  for classification problems, log-likelihood."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Trr4k5krVZks"},"source":["### **LightGBM Model**\n","\n","LightGBM is designed to be a \"light\" gradient boosting framework with several features that make it more efficient than other popular frameworks like XGBoost or CatBoost. One of the reasons why it's considered \"light\" is that it uses a vertical tree growth method that is more efficient than the horizontal growth method used by other frameworks.\n","\n","In traditional tree-based models such as decision trees and random forests, trees are grown level-wise, which means the algorithm grows the same level of nodes for each feature before moving to the next level. For example, if a tree has a depth of 3 and is being built on two features, the algorithm would first split the root node by selecting the best feature and threshold that maximizes the information gain. Then, it would split each of the resulting child nodes, and so on until the tree reaches the specified depth.\n","\n","In contrast, LightGBM grows trees leaf-wise, which means it first selects the leaf with the largest delta loss to grow. This method can reduce the loss more than a level-wise strategy when expanding the same leaf.\n","\n","For example, let's consider a dataset with one feature and 1000 samples. In a level-wise approach, the algorithm would split the first node into two nodes each with 500 samples, then split each of those nodes into two nodes each with 250 samples, and so on until the tree is fully grown. In contrast, in a leaf-wise approach, the algorithm would select the leaf with the largest delta loss, which could be any leaf at any depth, and grow that leaf first. This approach may result in fewer nodes being grown overall and can lead to faster training times and better accuracy.\n","\n","Light GBM is prefixed as ‘Light’ because of its high speed.

Some of the commonly used classification evaluation metrics are F1 score, recall score, confusion matrix, and ROC AUC score. Here's an overview of each of these metrics:\n","\n","**F1 score**: The F1 score is a metric that combines the precision and recall of a model into a single value. It is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and is expressed as a value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect precision and recall.\n","F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It is calculated as follows:\n","$$ F1 = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{precision} + \\frac{1}{recall}} $$\n","where precision is the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives, and recall is the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives.\n","\n","**Recall**: Use the recall score when the cost of false negatives (i.e., missing instances of a class) is high. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, the cost of missing a positive case may be high, so recall would be a more appropriate metric.\n","Recall score (also known as sensitivity) is the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives. It is given by the following formula:\n","$$ Recall = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} $$\n","\n","**Precision**: Precision is another important classification evaluation metric, which is defined as the ratio of true positives to the total predicted positives. It measures the accuracy of positive predictions made by the classifier, i.e., the proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.\n","The formula for precision is:\n","$$ precision = \\frac{true\\ positive}{true\\ positive + false\\ positive} $$\n","where true positive refers to the cases where the model correctly predicted the positive class, and false positive refers to the cases where the model incorrectly predicted the positive class.\n","Precision is useful when the cost of false positives is high, such as in medical diagnosis or fraud detection, where a false positive can have serious consequences. In such cases, a higher precision indicates that the model is better at identifying true positives and minimizing false positives.\n","\n","**Confusion Matrix**:\n","A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It compares the predicted labels with the true labels and counts the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. Here is an example of a confusion matrix:\n","\n","|          | Actual Positive | Actual Negative |\n","|----------|----------------|----------------|\n","| Predicted Positive | True Positive (TP) | False Positive (FP) |\n","| Predicted Negative | False Negative (FN) | True Negative (TN) |\n","\n","​\n","\n","\n","\n","**ROC AUC Score**:\n","ROC AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve) score is a measure of how well a classifier is able to distinguish between positive and negative classes. It is calculated as the area under the ROC curve. The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. TPR is the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives, and FPR is the number of false positives divided by the sum of false positives and true negatives.\n","$$ ROC\\ AUC\\ Score = \\int_0^1 TPR(FPR^{-1}(t)) dt $$\n","where $FPR^{-1}$ is the inverse of the FPR function.\n","\n","**When to use which**:\n","\n","The choice of evaluation metric depends on the specific requirements of the business problem. Here are some general guidelines:\n","\n","* F1 score: Use the F1 score when the class distribution is imbalanced, and when both precision and recall are equally important.\n","\n","* Recall score: Use the recall score when the cost of false negatives (i.e., missing instances of a class) is high. For example, in a medical diagnosis problem, the cost of missing a positive case may be high, so recall would be a more appropriate metric.\n","\n","* Precision: Precision is useful when the cost of false positives is high, such as in medical diagnosis or fraud detection, where a false positive can have serious consequences. In such cases, a higher precision indicates that the model is better at identifying true positives and minimizing false positives.\n","\n","* Confusion matrix: The confusion matrix is a versatile tool that can be used to visualize the performance of a model across different classes. It can be useful for identifying specific areas of the model that need improvement.\n","\n","* ROC AUC score: Use the ROC AUC score when the ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes is important. For example, in a credit scoring problem, the ability to distinguish between good and bad credit risks is crucial.\n","\n","Importance with respect to the business problem:\n","\n","The importance of each evaluation metric varies depending on the business problem. For example, in a spam detection problem, precision may be more important than recall, since false positives (i.e., classifying a non-spam email as spam) may annoy users, while false negatives (i.e., missing a spam email) may not be as harmful. On the other hand, in a disease diagnosis problem, recall may be more important than precision, since missing a positive case (i.e., a false negative) could have serious consequences. Therefore, it is important to choose the evaluation metric that is most relevant to the specific business problem at hand.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EhtmEHdre5RD"},"source":["## **Difference between Multiclass and Multilabel Classification**\n","\n","Multi-class classification refers to a classification task where the goal is to assign an input data point to one of several pre-defined categories. In multi-class classification, each data point can belong to only one class. Examples of multi-class classification tasks include digit recognition, where the goal is to identify handwritten digits from 0-9, or image classification, where the task is to classify images into different categories such as animals, plants, or buildings.\n","\n","On the other hand, multi-label classification refers to a classification task where the goal is to assign one or more labels to each input data point. In multi-label classification, each data point can belong to multiple classes. Examples of multi-label classification tasks include text categorization, where a given document can belong to multiple categories such as politics, sports, or entertainment, or image tagging, where an image can be tagged with multiple labels such as \"beach,\" \"sunset,\" \"ocean,\" etc.\n","\n","When dealing with multilabel classification problems, we have several approaches we can use to handle the problem.\n","\n","The first approach is the naive independent models approach. In this approach, we build separate models for each label and combine their predictions to determine the appropriate mode of transport. For example, we can train one model to predict whether a product will be transported by air, another model to predict whether it will be transported by road, and so on. The predictions of these models can then be combined to determine the final mode of transport.\n","\n","The second approach is the classifier chains approach. In this approach, we use a chain of classifiers, where the output of one classifier is fed into the next classifier to predict the labels. For example, we can train a model to predict whether a product will be transported by air, and then use the output of this model as an input to another model that predicts whether it will be transported by road, and so on.\n","\n","The third approach is the natively multilabel models approach. In this approach, we use models designed to handle multilabel classification tasks, such as Extra Trees and Neural Networks. These models are trained to predict multiple labels simultaneously. The models predict the probability of each label being present in the input. The model outputs a set of predicted probabilities for each label, and a threshold is used to determine which labels to assign to the input.\n","\n","The fourth approach is the multilabel to multiclass approach. In this approach, we convert the multilabel problem into a multiclass problem by combining different combinations of labels and training the model to predict these combinations. After prediction, we separate the combinations back into individual labels. For example, we can train a model to predict whether a product will be transported by air and road, air and rail, road and rail, and so on. The model can then predict one of these combinations, which can be separated back into individual labels.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"TUKHVZ4Mry1U"},"source":["\\begin{array}{ccc}\n","\\text{Method}&\\text{Any Model}&\\text{Num Models}&\\text{Cross-information}&\\text{Order independent}&\\text{Scale well}\\\\\n","Independent & ✔️ & N & ❌ & ✔️ & ✔️ \\\\\n","Chain       & ✔️ & N & ✔️ & ❌ & ✔️ \\\\\n","Native      & ❌ & 1 & ✔️ & ✔️ & ✔️ \\\\\n","Multiclass  & ✔️ & 1 & ✔️ & ✔️ & ❌ \\\\\n","\\end{array}"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":67,"metadata":{"id":"Pv9tEqvVm29W","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736712734658,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":2394,"user":{"displayName":"Trang Thao","userId":"09726438036581574948"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn import model_selection, multioutput, metrics\n","import lightgbm"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7dNwI-WhnJG9"},"source":["### **Cross Validation**\n","\n","Cross-validation is a technique used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model on unseen data.

On the other hand, choosing randomly the split point of each node will reduce variance.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":71,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"9ElWvIoTfuh3","outputId":"42e70194-b98d-404d-d2c4-8fd09464b802","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736712851530,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":2049,"user":{"displayName":"Trang Thao","userId":"09726438036581574948"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["0\t0.8084\n","1\t0.8212\n","2\t0.8135\n","3\t0.7976\n","4\t0.7957\n","--------------\n"," \t0.8073\n"]}],"source":["from sklearn import ensemble\n","\n","_scores = [] # initialize a list to store f1 score of each fold\n","\n","# loop over each fold of the cross-validation\n","for fold_idx, (idxT, idxV) in enumerate(cv_folds):\n","\n","    # initialize an ExtraTreesClassifier model\n","    model = ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier()\n","\n","    # fit the model on training data and target labels\n","    model.fit(x.iloc[idxT].fillna(-100), y.iloc[idxT])\n","\n","    # predict the target labels on validation data\n","    p = model.predict(x.iloc[idxV].fillna(-100))\n","\n","    # calculate f1 score for each label and take average\n","    avg_f1_score = np.mean([metrics.f1_score(y.iloc[idxV].iloc[:, i].to_numpy().astype(int), p[:, i].astype(int)) for i in range(4)])\n","\n","    # append the f1 score to the list\n","    _scores.append(avg_f1_score)\n","\n","    # print the f1 score of each fold\n","    print(\"%d\\t%.4f\" % (fold_idx, avg_f1_score))\n","\n","# print the mean f1 score across all folds\n","print(\"--------------\")\n","print(\" \\t%.4f\" % np.mean(_scores))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JOZNUFqbnlyx"},"source":["### **Neural Networks**\n","\n","Neural networks, also known as artificial neural networks, are a type of machine learning algorithm inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are composed of interconnected nodes, or artificial neurons, that are organized into layers to process and analyze data.\n","\n","The structure of a neural network typically includes an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer is where data is fed into the network, and the output layer produces the final output of the network. The hidden layers are where the majority of the processing takes place and where the neural network learns to identify patterns and make predictions.\n","\n","Each node in a neural network takes input data, processes it, and produces an output signal that is passed on to other nodes in the network. The processing that occurs within a node is typically composed of two parts: a linear transformation and a nonlinear activation function.\n","\n","The linear transformation is simply a weighted sum of the inputs to the node, where each input is multiplied by a corresponding weight. The weights determine the strength of the connection between the input and the node and are learned by the neural network during the training process.\n","\n","The output of the linear transformation is then passed through a nonlinear activation function, which is used to introduce nonlinearity into the neural network. Nonlinearity is important because many real-world problems are inherently nonlinear, and a neural network without nonlinear activation functions would be limited in its ability to model these problems.\n","\n","There are many different types of activation functions used in neural networks, including sigmoid, tanh, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and softmax. Each activation function has its own strengths and weaknesses and is chosen based on the specific requirements of the problem being solved.\n","\n","During the training process, the neural network is fed input data along with corresponding output data, and the weights between the nodes are adjusted to minimize the difference between the network's predictions and the actual output. This process is known as backpropagation, and it uses an optimization algorithm such as gradient descent to iteratively adjust the weights until the network produces accurate predictions.\n","\n","Once the neural network has been trained, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. The input data is fed into the network, and the output of the final layer represents the network's prediction for that input.\n","\n","#### **Activation Functions**\n","\n","Activation functions are one of the crucial components of neural networks. They introduce nonlinearity to the model, allowing it to approximate complex functions. Activation functions apply a mathematical operation to the weighted sum of inputs, known as the activation value, and produce an output that passes to the next layer.\n","\n","The role of activation functions is to introduce non-linearity into the output of a neuron. Without non-linearity, the model would be limited to linear transformations of the input. As a result, the output would be a linear function of the input, which is not suitable for many real-world problems that are highly non-linear in nature.\n","\n","There are several types of activation functions, some of which are as follows:\n","\n","* Sigmoid Function: The sigmoid function is one of the oldest activation functions and is still used today. The sigmoid function maps any input to a value between 0 and 1. The sigmoid function is often used in binary classification problems, where the output is either 0 or 1. The sigmoid function is defined as:\n","$$f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$$\n","where z is the input to the sigmoid function.\n","\n","* ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) Function: The ReLU function is one of the most widely used activation functions. The ReLU function sets any negative value in the input to zero and leaves the positive values unchanged. The ReLU function is defined as:\n","$$f(z) = \\max(0, z)$$\n","where z is the input to the ReLU function.\n","\n","* Leaky ReLU Function: Leaky ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is a type of activation function used in neural networks. It is similar to the standard ReLU function but with a small modification to address a limitation of the standard ReLU function.\n","The standard ReLU function returns 0 for any negative input and a linear output for positive inputs. However, the problem with the standard ReLU function is that when the input is negative, the gradient of the function is 0, which can lead to a problem known as \"dying ReLU.\" This occurs when the weights in the network become so large that the inputs to the ReLU function are always negative, causing the gradients to be 0 and the weights to stop updating during training.\n","Leaky ReLU addresses this problem by adding a small slope to the negative part of the function. Specifically, the function returns the input if it is positive, but returns a small fraction (often 0.01) of the input if it is negative. This ensures that the function always has a gradient and prevents the \"dying ReLU\" problem.\n","$$f(z) = \\max(0.01z, z)$$\n","where z is the input to the leaky ReLU function. The leaky ReLU function is often used when the ReLU function fails to provide good results.\n","\n","* Softmax Function: The softmax function is often used in multi-class classification problems, where the output is one of several classes. The softmax function maps the input to a probability distribution over the output classes. The softmax function is defined as:\n","$$f(x_i) = \\frac{e^{x_i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{k}e^{x_j}}$$\n","where $k$ is the number of classes and $x_i$ is the input to the $i$-th class\n","\n","There are two main stages in the training of neural networks: forward propagation and backpropagation. In forward propagation, the input data is passed through the network to generate a prediction or output. In backpropagation, the error in the prediction is calculated and used to update the weights of the network. This process is repeated iteratively until the error is minimized.\n","\n","**Forward Propagation**:\n","\n","In forward propagation, the input data is passed through the network from the input layer to the output layer. Each layer in the network consists of a set of nodes, or neurons, which perform a simple computation on their inputs. The output of one layer is fed as input to the next layer until the final output is produced.\n","\n","The computation performed by each neuron is based on the activation function applied to the weighted sum of its inputs. The activation function is used to introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to model more complex relationships between the input and output data.\n","\n","**Backpropagation**:\n","\n","In backpropagation, the error in the prediction is calculated and used to update the weights of the network. The error is typically measured using a loss function, which compares the predicted output with the actual output. The goal of backpropagation is to minimize the loss function by adjusting the weights of the network.\n","\n","The process of backpropagation involves calculating the derivative of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network. This derivative is then used to update the weights of the network in the opposite direction of the gradient, in order to minimize the loss function.\n","\n","**Optimizers**:\n","\n","Optimizers are algorithms used to update the weights of the neural network during the backpropagation process. They are used to find the optimal set of weights that minimize the loss function. There are several different types of optimizers available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some common optimizers include:\n","\n","* Gradient Descent: Gradient descent is a simple optimizer that works by adjusting the weights of the network in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. It is a first-order optimization method and is often used as a baseline for more complex optimizers.\n","\n","* Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): SGD is a variant of gradient descent that updates the weights using a small batch of data at a time, rather than the entire dataset. This can lead to faster convergence and better generalization.\n","\n","* Adam: Adam is an adaptive optimizer that adjusts the learning rate based on the gradient variance and moving average of the gradients. It is an effective optimizer for a wide range of neural network architectures and is widely used in practice.\n","\n","* RMSProp: RMSProp is an adaptive optimizer that uses a moving average of the squared gradients to adjust the learning rate. It is effective for dealing with noisy gradients and is widely used in deep learning.\n","\n","### **Techniques to Counter Overfitting**\n","\n","Overfitting is a common problem in neural networks, which occurs when a model becomes too complex and starts to memorize the training data rather than learning the underlying patterns. This leads to poor generalization performance on new data. There are several techniques to counter overfitting in neural networks, some of which are:\n","\n","* Dropout: Dropout is a technique where a random selection of neurons are ignored during training. This technique helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the complex co-adaptations that can occur between neurons. Dropout randomly selects a fraction of the nodes in a layer and sets their output to zero during training. This makes the network more robust and prevents overfitting.\n","\n","* Data Augmentation: Data augmentation is a technique where we artificially increase the size of our training data by applying various transformations to the data. This helps to prevent overfitting by providing the model with more diverse examples to learn from. Data augmentation can include techniques like flipping, rotation, scaling, cropping, and color jittering.\n","\n","* Early Stopping: Early stopping is a technique where we stop training the model as soon as the performance on the validation data starts to deteriorate. This helps to prevent overfitting by preventing the model from overfitting to the training data. The idea behind early stopping is to stop training before the model starts to memorize the training data and starts to perform poorly on unseen data.\n","\n","* Regularization: Regularization is a technique where we add a penalty term to the loss function to prevent the model from overfitting. This is typically achieved by adding an L1 or L2 penalty term to the weights of the model. L1 regularization adds a penalty proportional to the absolute value of the weights while L2 regularization adds a penalty proportional to the square of the weights.\n","\n","* Batch Normalization: Batch normalization is a technique where we normalize the inputs to a layer to have zero mean and unit variance. This helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the internal covariate shift in the model. Internal covariate shift is when the distribution of inputs to a layer changes during training, which can make it difficult for the model to learn.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RrIQ3cCQF51E"},"source":["### **Sequential Layering**\n","\n","Sequential model building involves stacking multiple layers one after the other to form a feed-forward network. This architecture is also referred to as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP).\n","\n","In the given code, we start by importing the necessary libraries, including TensorFlow and Keras, which are the primary deep learning libraries. We also import TensorFlow Addons, which provides additional functionality to TensorFlow. We then split the data into training and validation sets using K-fold cross-validation, where we use a fraction of the data for training and the rest for validation.\n","\n","Next, we define the architecture of our neural network by creating an instance of a sequential model using the Keras Sequential API. The sequential model is a linear stack of layers, where each layer has an input and an output. The first layer in our model is the normalization layer, which normalizes the input data. We then add three dense layers with ReLU activation and dropout layers in between them to prevent overfitting. The last layer is a dense layer with a sigmoid activation function since we are dealing with binary classification. We then compile the model by specifying the optimizer and loss function.\n","\n","After compiling the model, we train it using the training data and validate it using the validation data. We train the model for 50 epochs, with a batch size of 32, and evaluate its performance by plotting the training and validation loss. Finally, we predict the labels for the validation data using the trained model and calculate the average F1 score as a performance metric."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3wyWrBqdfCsd"},"source":["\n","\n","```\n","# This is formatted as code\n","```\n","\n","### **Approach 2: Multilabel to Multiclass**\n","\n","Multilabel classification refers to the task of assigning multiple labels to a single instance. For instance, in the case of an image classification problem, an image can be associated with more than one label. On the other hand, multiclass classification refers to the task of assigning a single label to each instance. For instance, in an image classification problem, an image can only be associated with one label.\n","\n","In some cases, it may be more appropriate to convert a multilabel classification problem into a multiclass classification problem. This can be done by converting each unique combination of labels into a separate class. The advantage of this approach is that it allows the use of standard classification algorithms that are designed for multiclass classification problems.\n","\n","Now, let's consider the below code. The first section of the code is converting the multi-label encoded data to multi-class encoded data. It does this by first creating a copy of the original target variable y and then concatenating each row's values using a hyphen (-) separator. This concatenated string is then used as a unique code to identify each combination of the target variable's binary labels. The function drop_duplicates() removes the duplicate codes, and np.arange(y_codes.shape[0]) generates a sequence of integers from 0 to the number of unique codes. These unique codes are then merged back into the original target variable y using the merge() function to replace the binary labels with unique integers.\n","\n","The second section of the code is training and evaluating a multi-class classification model using the LightGBM algorithm. The model is trained and validated using k-fold cross-validation, where cv_folds are the indices of the training and validation sets for each fold.  After training the model, it generates predictions on the validation set using the predict() function. The predicted integer values are then converted back into the original binary label format using the unique codes generated earlier. Finally, the mean F1 score for each fold is computed and printed."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":84,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":260},"id":"_KR0BOuVqPgw","outputId":"b5956a3c-29f4-4777-839d-e8a6fae4a45a","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736713438563,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":15222,"user":{"displayName":"Trang Thao","userId":"09726438036581574948"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["<ipython-input-84-afae3bb1bbfe>:4: SettingWithCopyWarning: \n","A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.\n","Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead\n","\n","See the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n","  y_codes['idx'] = np.arange(y_codes.shape[0])\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["15 classes\n","0\t0.8042\n","1\t0.8093\n","2\t0.8018\n","3\t0.8023\n","4\t0.7741\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>"],"application/javascript":["\n","        window.kuchbhi=new Promise(resolve => {\n","            \n","\n","        function reqListener () {\n","\n","        var ipResponse = this.responseText\n","        console.log(ipResponse);\n","        //return ipResponse\n","\n","        const req2 = new XMLHttpRequest();\n","        req2.addEventListener(\"load\",function(){\n","\n","            //  this blocks runs after req2 and prints whole data    \n","        console.log(this.responseText)\n","        //IPython.notebook.kernel.execute(\n","            //     \"json_obj = \" + JSON.stringify(this.responseText, null, 4)\n","            // );\n","        //document.querySelector(\"#output-area\").appendChild(document.createTextNode(JSON.stringify(this.responseText)));\n","        //var command= \"json_obj = \" + JSON.stringify(this.responseText)\n","        //var kernel = IPython.notebook.kernel;\n","        //kernel.execute(command);\n","        resolve(JSON.parse(this.responseText))\n","\n","\n","        });\n","        req2.open(\"GET\", \"https://ipapi.co/\"+JSON.parse(ipResponse).ip+\"/json/\");\n","        req2.send();\n","\n","\n","        }\n","\n","        const req = new XMLHttpRequest();\n","        req.addEventListener(\"load\", reqListener);\n","        req.open(\"GET\", \"https://api64.ipify.org?format=json\");\n","        req.send();\n","\n","\n","\n","        }\n","        );\n","        //kuchbhi()\n","        "]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["--------------\n"," \t0.7983\n"]}],"source":["y_ = y.copy()\n","y_['code'] = y.apply(lambda x: '-'.join([str(xi) for xi in x]), axis=1)\n","y_codes = y_.drop_duplicates()\n","y_codes['idx'] = np.arange(y_codes.shape[0])\n","y_class = y_.merge(y_codes, on='code', how='left')['idx']\n","print(f\"{y_codes.shape[0]} classes\")\n","\n","_scores = []\n","for fold_idx, (idxT, idxV) in enumerate(cv_folds):\n","    model = lightgbm.LGBMClassifier(random_seed=42)\n","    model.fit(x.iloc[idxT], y_class.iloc[idxT])\n","\n","    p = model.predict(x.iloc[idxV])\n","    p = pd.DataFrame({'idx': p}).merge(y_codes, on='idx', how='left')[labels]\n","    avg_f1_score = np.mean([metrics.f1_score(y.iloc[idxV].iloc[:, i].to_numpy().astype(int), p.iloc[:, i].astype(int)) for i in range(4)])\n","    _scores.append(avg_f1_score)\n","    print(\"%d\\t%.4f\" % (fold_idx, avg_f1_score))\n","\n","model_snapshot(\"715840\")\n","print(\"--------------\")\n","print(\" \\t%.4f\" % np.mean(_scores))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kjF5SoczJ6NZ"},"source":["## **Conclusion**\n","\n","In this project, we explored different approaches to handle multilabel classification problems.

The first approach was to train separate binary classifiers for each target label, followed by the classifier chains approach where we chained the classifiers together to consider the dependencies between labels. Then, we explored natively multilabel models such as Extra Trees and Neural Networks. Finally, we combined different combinations of labels into a single target label and trained a lightgbm classifier on the combined labels.\n","\n","This project highlights the importance of choosing an appropriate approach when dealing with multilabel classification problems.

The Natively Multilabel Models approach is specifically designed for multilabel classification problems and can further improve performance.\n","\n","As observed in the project, the independent model approach performed better compared to the other approaches for this particular dataset. This can be attributed to the fact that the target labels in this dataset, such as sea, air, and road, are relatively independent of each other.\n","\n","Therefore, it was more effective to train separate binary classifiers for each target label instead of considering the dependencies between them. However, it is important to note that this may not always be the case for other datasets with more complex and interdependent target labels."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
