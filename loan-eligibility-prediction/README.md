# Loan Eligibility Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting loan eligibility using a Gradient Boosting Classifier. The objective is to build a robust model that identifies eligible applicants based on a set of predefined features. This project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model optimization.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand key patterns and trends.
- Implement a Gradient Boosting Classifier to predict loan eligibility.
- Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.
- Optimize the model to improve accuracy and minimize errors.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes applicant details, loan characteristics, and other features relevant to determining loan eligibility.

### Key Fields:
- **Applicant Details:** Gender, Marital Status, Education, Dependents, Income (Applicant and Coapplicant).
- **Loan Details:** Loan Amount, Loan Term, Credit History.
- **Categorical Variables:** Property Area, Self-Employed status.
- **Target Variable:** Loan Status (Eligible or Not Eligible).

## Approach

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze data distribution and identify patterns.
- Visualize trends and relationships between features.
- Detect and handle outliers and missing values.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Create new features to enhance predictive power.
- Encode categorical variables using techniques such as One-Hot Encoding.
- Normalize and scale numerical features to ensure uniformity.

### 3. Model Implementation
- Train a Gradient Boosting Classifier to predict loan eligibility.
- Split the data into training and testing sets for evaluation.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
- Perform cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
- Visualize the results using confusion matrices and ROC curves.

### 5. Optimization
- Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
- Analyze feature importance to identify key drivers of loan eligibility.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - Data Manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Data Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - Machine Learning: `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`

## Key Insights
