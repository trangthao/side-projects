# **Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) Estimation**

This project demonstrates the estimation of Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) using modern causal inference techniques. It uses Python libraries like `econml` to estimate treatment effects under different conditions, enabling the analysis of heterogeneous treatment effects for decision-making.

## **Problem Statement**

In digital advertising, it is critical to identify users who are most likely to respond positively to a given campaign. Traditional methods often focus on average effects, which can lead to wasted resources by targeting users who either would not respond or would respond even without the campaign. The challenge lies in estimating **Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE)** to personalize ad targeting and maximize campaign efficiency.

## **Objectives**

1. Demonstrate the use of `econml` for CATE estimation.
2. Apply modern causal inference techniques to analyze treatment heterogeneity.
3. Provide actionable insights based on CATE estimation for personalized decision-making.

## **Dataset Overview**

The Criteo Uplift Modeling Dataset contains real-world data for uplift modeling and CATE estimation, featuring:
- Treatment Variable: Whether a user was exposed to an advertisement.
- Outcome Variable: Whether the user performed a specific action (e.g., clicked or converted).
- Covariates: User attributes and contextual features.

Key characteristics:
- Includes millions of rows, making it suitable for robust causal analysis.
- Designed for benchmarking uplift models in the advertising domain.

## **Approach**

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Import necessary libraries and datasets.
   - Process the data for causal inference analysis.

2. **Causal Estimation Framework:**
   - Use `econml` library to apply CATE estimators like:
     - Double Machine Learning (DML).
     - Meta-learners (e.g., T-learners, S-learners).
   - Handle confounding variables effectively.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - Train models to estimate uplift for different user segments.
   - Evaluate using metrics like Qini and Uplift curves.
  
4. **Insights and Recommendations:**
   - Visualize uplift and treatment effects to identify high-impact segments.
   - Provide actionable insights for campaign targeting.
