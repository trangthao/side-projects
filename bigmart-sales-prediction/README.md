# Bigmart Sales Prediction

## Business Context
Bigmart is a retail company, and the goal of this project is to predict sales data for their stores using historical data. By accurately forecasting sales, Bigmart can optimize stock management, promotional strategies, and supply chain operations, ensuring that they meet demand without overstocking. This will help in making informed decisions about product placement, promotions, and inventory, ultimately leading to increased profitability.

## Key Terms
- **Sales**: The total amount of revenue generated from selling products in a store.
- **Prediction**: Estimating future sales based on historical data and various factors like store, product category, and promotions.
- **Features**: The data points used to predict sales, including product information, store characteristics, and promotion details.

## Data Overview
We have information about Bigmart's sales performance, including:

- **Store Information**: Details about the store like type, location, and size.
- **Product Information**: Product categories, item weight, and other product-specific details.
- **Sales Data**: Historical sales data, which includes the sales volume for each store and product.

The dataset includes columns such as:

- **Item_Identifier**: Unique identifier for each product.
- **Store_Identifier**: Unique identifier for each store.
- **Sales**: The number of items sold.
- **Store_Size**: The size of the store.
- **Item_Weight**: The weight of the product.
- **Category**: The product category (e.g., food, beverage, electronics).
- **Date**: The date of sales.

## Objective
The objective of this notebook is to predict the sales for Bigmart's products using machine learning models. By predicting sales accurately, Bigmart can improve inventory management, optimize pricing strategies, and align promotional activities with expected demand. This will lead to more efficient operations and increased profitability.

## Libraries
The following libraries are required to run the notebook for Python 3.10.12:

- `pandas==1.5.3`
- `numpy==1.24.4`
- `matplotlib==3.7.3`
- `seaborn==0.12.2`
- `scipy==1.10.1`
- `scikit_learn==1.2.2`
- `xgboost==1.7.6`
- `lightgbm==3.3.5`
- `keras==2.11.0`
- `tensorflow==2.11.1`

## Notebook Overview
1. **Business Context**: The notebook starts by providing an understanding of the business context of the project, emphasizing how accurate sales prediction can drive operational efficiency and profitability.
2. **Data Preparation**: The data is cleaned, missing values are handled, and relevant features are extracted.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA is performed to visualize relationships between variables like sales and store/product characteristics. This includes checking for correlations, distributions, and outliers.
4. **Modeling**: Various machine learning models, including Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and MLP Regressor, are explored to predict sales. Cross-validation is used to evaluate model performance.
5. **Evaluation**: The models are evaluated using metrics such as R-squared, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). The best model is selected based on these metrics.
